- Freddie Mac (McLean, VA)
- Navy Federal Credit Union (Vienna, VA)
- PenFed Credit Union (Tysons, VA)

- Capital Bank N.A. (Rockville, MD)

**High-Impact Event Criteria (≥ $10M unless noted):**
1. Product launches or major platform upgrades (data, AI, risk analytics, Internal Audit)
2. Funding, M&A activity, or partnership announcements ≥ $10M
3. Regulatory actions (Matters Requiring Attention, consent orders, supervisory letters, fines)
4. Published RFPs or procurement notices ≥ $10M (keywords: "RFP," "SOW," "consultant")
5. Earnings-call guidance citing ≥ $10M spend on AI, model risk, data, or cloud initiatives
6. Senior job postings (Director+) in Model Risk, AI Governance, Data Science, or Internal Audit

8. Data breaches or major outages tied to analytics and ML systems
9. New/expanded Form 10-Q/10-K risk-factor language regarding model risk, AI, data governance, Internal Audit, or material weaknesses

**Classification Guidelines:**
- **Relevance**: Text is relevant if it identifies a target company AND meets at least one high-impact criteria, OR discusses clear financial/procurement/partnership details for that company
- **Irrelevant**: Generic market reports without direct target company events, or simple name drops in marketing context

**Categories:**
- "SEC Filing": 8-K, 10-Q, 10-K filings
- "News Article": Announcements, press releases, media coverage
- "Procurement Notice": RFP or consultant proposals
- "Irrelevant": Doesn't meet criteria or relate to target companies
