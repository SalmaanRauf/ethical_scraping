- **Repository Recon Digest** (≤ 200 lines) at the start of any work:
  - high‑level architecture
  - key modules & dependencies
  - tech‑debt hot‑spots
- Follow the **Recon → Plan → Execute → Verify** loop for every change.
- Surface architectural risks and scalability concerns early.
- Escalate only when the “clarification threshold” is hit (requirements unclear).
