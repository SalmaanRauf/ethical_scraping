# Enhanced Company Intelligence Chat System

## Overview

The Company Intelligence Chat System has been significantly enhanced to handle any user request with intelligent intent resolution and parallel task execution. The system now supports:

- **Any Company Analysis**: No longer restricted to hardcoded companies
- **General Research**: Market overviews, industry analysis, regulatory updates
- **Mixed Requests**: Company briefing + competitor analysis in one request
- **Intent Resolution**: LLM-based understanding with rule-based fallback
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple tasks run concurrently for efficiency

## Architecture Changes

### Phase 1: Intent Resolution Layer

#### New Components:
- `services/intent_resolver.py` - LLM-based intent resolution with rule fallback
- `services/enhanced_router.py` - Enhanced routing using intent resolver
- `sk_functions/Intent_Resolver_prompt.txt` - SK function for intent resolution

#### Key Features:
- **Intent Types**: COMPANY_BRIEFING, GENERAL_RESEARCH, MIXED_REQUEST, FOLLOW_UP, COMPARISON, CLARIFICATION
- **Task Types**: COMPANY_BRIEFING, GENERAL_RESEARCH, COMPETITOR_ANALYSIS, COMPARISON, FOLLOW_UP
- **Confidence Scoring**: LLM provides confidence levels for intent resolution
- **Fallback Reliability**: Rule-based routing when LLM fails

### Phase 2: Enhanced Bing Agent

#### New Methods in `agents/bing_data_extraction_agent.py`:
- `search_market_overview()` - Market rankings and overviews
- `search_industry_analysis()` - Comprehensive industry analysis
- `search_regulatory_updates()` - Regulatory changes and updates
- `search_competitor_analysis()` - Enhanced competitor analysis
- `search_general_topic()` - Any general research topic
- `search_company_any()` - Research any company (no restrictions)
- `search_financial_companies_by_location()` - Location-specific company lists
- `search_technology_trends()` - Technology trend analysis
- `search_market_rankings()` - Market ranking information

#### New Orchestrator:
- `tools/general_research_orchestrator.py` - Handles non-company research requests

### Phase 3: Task Execution & Response Formatting

#### New Components:
- `tools/task_executor.py` - Parallel task execution coordinator
- `tools/response_formatter.py` - Unified response formatting
- Enhanced `tools/orchestrators.py` - New orchestration functions

#### Key Features:
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple tasks run concurrently
- **Task Prioritization**: Tasks executed in priority order
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with partial results
- **Response Synthesis**: Unified formatting for different response types

## Usage Examples

### 1. Company Briefing (Any Company)
```
User: "Tell me about Tesla"
System: Executes full company analysis for Tesla
```

### 2. General Research
```
User: "What are the top 30 financial firms in Puerto Rico?"
System: Searches for market overview and rankings
```

### 3. Mixed Request
```
User: "Tell me about Capital One and its top competitors"
System: 
- Executes company briefing for Capital One
- Executes competitor analysis for Capital One
- Combines results into unified response
```

### 4. Follow-up Questions
```
User: "What about their earnings?"
System: Uses existing context to answer follow-up
```

### 5. Company Comparison
```
User: "Compare Apple and Microsoft"
System: Executes briefings for both companies and compares
```

## API Changes

### New Main Entry Point
```python
from tools.orchestrators import enhanced_user_request_handler

response = await enhanced_user_request_handler(
    user_input="Tell me about Tesla and its competitors",
    context=conversation_context,
    bing_agent=bing_agent,
    analyst_agent=analyst_agent,
    progress=progress_callback
)
```

### Response Format
All responses now follow a unified format:
```python
{
    "type": "company_briefing|general_research|mixed_request|comparison|follow_up|error",
    "intent_type": "resolved_intent_type",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "reasoning": "explanation_of_resolution",
    "summary": "main_response_content",
    "sections": [...],  # For mixed requests
    "citations": [...],  # All citations
    "execution_time": 2.5
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The system requires the same environment variables as before:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `BASE_URL`
- `API_VERSION`
- `MODEL`
- `PROJECT_ID`
- `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`
- `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
- `AZURE_BING_CONNECTION_ID`

### SK Functions
The system automatically loads the new intent resolver function:
- `Intent_Resolver_prompt.txt` - For LLM-based intent resolution

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- LLM intent resolution fails → Falls back to rule-based routing
- Individual tasks fail → Other tasks continue, partial results returned
- API timeouts → Graceful error messages with retry suggestions

### Logging
Comprehensive logging at all levels:
- Intent resolution decisions
- Task execution progress
- Error conditions and fallbacks
- Performance metrics

## Performance Optimizations

### Parallel Execution
- Multiple tasks run concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`
- Task prioritization ensures important tasks complete first
- Memory management for large datasets

### Caching
- Company briefings cached with TTL
- Intent resolution results cached for similar requests
- Citation deduplication across tasks

### Timeout Management
- Configurable timeouts for different task types
- Graceful handling of slow API responses
- Progress callbacks for long-running operations

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive testing:
- Import validation for all new modules
- Intent resolution testing with various input types
- Router testing with different scenarios
- Error handling validation

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code
1. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
2. **New Entry Point**: Use `enhanced_user_request_handler()` for new features
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `full_company_analysis()` still works

### For New Features
1. **Intent Resolution**: Automatically handles complex requests
2. **General Research**: Use for non-company research needs
3. **Mixed Requests**: Handle multiple intents in single request

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Custom Search Strategies**: User-defined research approaches
2. **Advanced Caching**: Redis-based distributed caching
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based progress updates
4. **Custom Prompts**: User-configurable analysis prompts
5. **Export Formats**: PDF, Excel, Word document generation

### Scalability Improvements
1. **Microservices**: Split into independent services
2. **Queue System**: Redis-based task queuing
3. **Load Balancing**: Multiple worker instances
4. **Database**: Persistent storage for results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Missing**: System falls back to rule-based routing
2. **Timeout Errors**: Check network connectivity and API limits
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce chunk sizes or max chunks
4. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies installed

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check logs for detailed error information
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with simple requests first
4. Use the test script to validate functionality
