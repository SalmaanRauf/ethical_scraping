- FOLLOW_UP: User is asking follow-up questions based on existing context
- COMPARISON: User wants to compare multiple companies
- CLARIFICATION: User input is unclear or needs clarification

**Available Task Types:**
- COMPANY_BRIEFING: Full company analysis (SEC, news, earnings, industry context)
