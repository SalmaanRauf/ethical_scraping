# Deep Research SDK Parameter Fix - Resolution Summary

## Issue Discovered

The original fix I provided was **based on incorrect documentation** and made the problem worse. After inspecting the actual Azure SDK, I found the true parameter names.

## Root Cause

**SDK Version Mismatch in Documentation:**
- Your installed SDK: `azure-ai-agents==1.1.0b3`
- Documentation I referenced: Based on assumed parameters from user research
- **Reality**: The SDK uses different parameter names than what the documentation suggested

## Actual SDK Parameter Names (from SDK inspection)

```python
DeepResearchDetails(
    deep_research_model="o3-deep-research",  # ✅ Correct (with deep_research_ prefix)
    deep_research_bing_grounding_connections=[...]  # ✅ Correct (with deep_research_ prefix)
)
```

**Not** (as I incorrectly suggested):
```python
DeepResearchDetails(
    model="o3-deep-research",  # ❌ Wrong
    bing_grounding_connections=[...]  # ❌ Wrong
)
```

## SDK Attributes Confirmed

Via `python -c "from azure.ai.agents.models import DeepResearchDetails; print(dir(DeepResearchDetails))"`:

```
['deep_research_model', 'deep_research_bing_grounding_connections', ...]
```

## The Fix

**File:** `services/deep_research_client.py`

**Changed From (my incorrect fix):**
```python
deep_research=DeepResearchDetails(
    model=self._deep_model,  # ❌ Wrong
    bing_grounding_connections=[...]  # ❌ Wrong
)
```

**Changed To (correct):**
```python
deep_research=DeepResearchDetails(
    deep_research_model=self._deep_model,  # ✅ Correct
    deep_research_bing_grounding_connections=[...]  # ✅ Correct
)
```

## Why This Happened

1. **Initial error message was misleading** - It mentioned `'bing_grounding_connections'` as unexpected, which suggested the prefix was wrong
2. **Documentation discrepancy** - The user's research showed examples using `model` and `bing_grounding_connections` without the `deep_research_` prefix
3. **SDK version evolution** - The API might have changed between SDK versions, or the documentation was for a different version

## Environment Variables (No Changes Needed)

Your `.env` configuration is **correct** and doesn't need any changes:

```bash
# These are for the analyst agent (GPT-4.1) ✅
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
BASE_URL=...
MODEL=gpt-4-1-preview-2024-08-06
PROJECT_ID=...

# These are for Deep Research ✅
PROJECT_ENDPOINT=...
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o-20241120-gs-dev  # ✅ Correct
DEEP_RESEARCH_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=o3-deep-research  # ✅ Correct
BING_CONNECTION_NAME=/subscriptions/4828f...  # ✅ Correct (connection ID)
ENABLE_DEEP_RESEARCH=true  # ✅ Correct
```

## Testing

After this fix, Deep Research should initialize correctly. The agent will use:
- **Primary model (gpt-4o)**: For intent clarification (Phase 1)
- **Deep research model (o3-deep-research)**: For multi-hop research (Phase 3)
- **Bing Grounding**: For web data ingestion (Phase 2)

## Error Handling Improvements

Also updated error messages to:
1. Display the actual installed SDK version
2. Show the expected parameter names
3. Provide better diagnostic information

## Verification Command

To verify the SDK parameters in the future:
```bash
python -c "from azure.ai.agents.models import DeepResearchDetails; import inspect; print([attr for attr in dir(DeepResearchDetails) if not attr.startswith('_')])"
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Parameter names are now correct
2. ✅ Error handling is improved
3. ⏳ Test by running the application
4. ⏳ Verify Deep Research mode works end-to-end

## Apology

I apologize for the initial incorrect fix. The documentation and user research suggested different parameter names than what the actual SDK version 1.1.0b3 uses. I should have verified against the actual SDK installation first before making changes. The correct approach (which I've now applied) was to inspect the SDK directly.
