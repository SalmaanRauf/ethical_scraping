### Sources (15+ minimum, categorized)

**Strategic Announcements:**
- [Press releases, investor presentations, cloud provider case studies]

**Market Intelligence:**
- [Job postings, analyst reports, industry publications]

## Critical Rules

Start with SEC filings - companies must disclose material IT investments and cyber risks
Check state breach notification databases for cybersecurity incidents
Monitor earnings call transcripts for technology strategy announcements
Use LinkedIn/job postings to infer project scale (e.g., hiring 20 cloud engineers = major migration)
Include specific details: breach size, investment amounts, technology platforms
 Never fabricate breaches or technology initiatives
 Don't rely on vendor marketing - verify with company's official communications

Focus on mid-market to enterprise companies ($500M+ revenue) where technology transformation, security incidents, or leadership changes create clear consulting needs. CIO transitions and data breaches are highest-value opportunities because they create immediate buying windows.

For each opportunity, consider cross-sell potential: cloud migration -> data governance -> AI implementation -> ongoing managed services.
