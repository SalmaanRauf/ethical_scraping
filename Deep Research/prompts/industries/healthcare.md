## Critical Rules

Search FDA enforcement database first - warning letters create immediate needs
Check ClinicalTrials.gov for Phase III/pivotal trials indicating large sponsor activity
Verify HIPAA breaches via official OCR breach portal
Include specific details: trial NCT numbers, FDA warning letter dates, breach size
Cross-reference company announcements with official regulatory sources
 Never fabricate FDA actions or clinical trial information
 Don't rely on press releases - verify with FDA.gov or ClinicalTrials.gov

Focus on organizations with significant regulatory footprint (multi-site operations, commercial products, large trials) where compliance or operational challenges create clear consulting needs. FDA warning letters and major HIPAA breaches are highest-value opportunities.
