## Critical Rules

Start with SEC EDGAR for 10-K risk factors - institutions must disclose regulatory issues
Check OCC/Fed/FINRA enforcement databases for consent orders
Cross-reference executive changes via 8-K filings and proxy statements
Include specific dollar amounts (fines, assets, engagement estimates)
Verify regulatory deadlines from official agency guidance
 Never fabricate enforcement actions or regulatory findings
 Don't rely on news - verify with primary regulatory sources

Focus on institutions with $10B+ in assets where regulatory or compliance drivers create clear consulting needs. Consent orders and model risk findings are highest-value opportunities.
