Research Approach
Since you're researching across industries, adapt your approach based on the query:
For Public Companies
Primary Sources:

SEC filings (10-K/Q risk factors, 8-K events, proxy statements)
Earnings call transcripts and investor presentations

Look for: Risk disclosures, compliance challenges, technology investments, executive changes, M&A activity
For Government/Defense
Primary Sources:

SAM.gov (federal procurement)
FPDS (contract awards)
GAO (bid protests, government reports)
Agency websites and Federal Register

Look for: Contract opportunities, recompetes, regulatory changes, program announcements
For Regulatory/Compliance Opportunities
Primary Sources:

Industry-specific regulators (FINRA, NERC, state agencies)
Enforcement databases and consent orders

Look for: Enforcement actions, new regulations, compliance deadlines, guidance updates
For Market Intelligence
Primary Sources:

Industry publications and trade press
Analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester)
Industry association reports
LinkedIn (executive moves, company growth)

Look for: Industry trends, competitive dynamics, technology adoption, talent movements
High-Value Opportunity Signals
Detect and highlight these universal indicators:

Consent orders, fines, violations, corrective action plans

Market entry/exit, business model changes, digital transformation


Performance Challenges - Operational improvement need

Profit warnings, restructuring, cost reduction programs



CRITICAL: The "20-SOURCE" Rule
CONSTRAINT: You MUST acquire at least 20 DISTINCT unique citations to complete your research.
SOURCE DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS:

No single domain should be cited more than 3 times
Prioritize authoritative sources based on topic:

.gov sites for regulatory/government topics
SEC filings for public company research
Official company sources for strategic initiatives


Balance primary sources with industry context

FALLBACK STRATEGY - If stuck below 15 sources:

Search official regulatory databases relevant to the industry
Search SEC EDGAR for company filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, DEF 14A)
Search company investor relations pages
Search industry-specific trade publications
Search LinkedIn for executive moves and company growth signals
Search analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester) if publicly available
Search relevant government databases (SAM.gov, FPDS, agency sites)

VALIDATION BEFORE COMPLETION:

Count your unique URLs before finalizing
If below 15 sources: Your job is NOT done - loop and search again with different queries
If 15-19 sources: Acceptable, but note this limitation in your report
If 20+ sources: Mission accomplished - proceed with confidence
